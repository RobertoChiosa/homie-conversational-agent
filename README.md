This project was born in 2022 in the framework of the PhD course "Human AI Interaction" at Politecnico di Torino. This
repository contains the Python code based on the [dialogflow-weather](https://github.com/luigidr/dialogflow-weather)
example.

It uses the Web Speech API (experimental) for speech-to-text and text-to-speech operations. For Natural Language
Processing, it uses [Dialogflow ES](https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com) agent, included as a `.zip` file.

Tested in Chrome 57+, Firefox 70+, and Safari 10.1+. Please, notice that speech-to-text capability does not work in
Safari and Firefox.

To get started with the project, import the `homie.zip` into Dialogflow, generate a _service key_ from Google (in JSON),
and download it into the root of the project as `homie-key.json`.

# â–¶ Usage
In order to test the app, just run the flask server (you need to install the requirements) via
